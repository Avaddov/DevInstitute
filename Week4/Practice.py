# Exercise 1
# Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
# Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

# name = input("Name?")
# age = int(input("age?"))

# year = str((2020 - age)+100)
# print(f"{name} will be 100 years old in the year {year}")

# Exercise 2
# Ask the user for a number. 
# Depending on whether the number is even or odd, 
# print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

# num = int(input("pick a number."))
# mod = num % 2
# if mod > 0:
#     print("odd")
# else:
#     print("even")

# Exercise 3
# # Take a list, say for example this one:
# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# #and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.
# print([num for num in a if num < 5])
